# QSharp-Rand

QSharp-Rand is a Quantum Computing project implemented in Q# that focuses on generating random numbers, sorting them, and filtering prime numbers using quantum algorithms.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how quantum computing techniques can be utilized to perform certain tasks more efficiently compared to classical computing methods.
By leveraging quantum operations and algorithms provided by Microsoft Quantum Development Kit,
QSharp-Rand showcases the power of quantum computing in solving problems related to randomness generation and number manipulation.

## Features

- **Random Number Generation**: Generates a list of random numbers within a specified range using quantum random number generation techniques.
- **Sorting**: Implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort the generated random numbers.
- **Prime Number Filtering**: Utilizes classical algorithms to filter prime numbers from the sorted list.

## Usage

To use QSharp-Rand, follow these steps:

1. Install the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK) on your machine. You can find installation instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/install-guide/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the solution in Visual Studio or any Q# development environment.
4. Build the project to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
5. Run the `Main` operation in the `Sample.qs` file to execute the random number generation, sorting, and prime number filtering process.
